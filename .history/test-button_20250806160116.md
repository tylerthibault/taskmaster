# TaskMaster Test File

This is a test file to verify that the TaskMaster plugin is working.

## Test Buttons

Here's a simple test button: {{multi-state-button:test-btn:todo}}

Another test button: {{multi-state-button:second-btn:in-progress}}

And a third one: {{multi-state-button:third-btn:done}}

## Instructions

1. Load the TaskMaster plugin in Obsidian
2. Open this file in reading mode (Ctrl+E or Cmd+E)
3. You should see buttons instead of the text above
4. Click the buttons - they should cycle through states and show notices

If you see this working, the basic plugin is functional!

## Debug Information

- Make sure debug mode is enabled in TaskMaster settings
- Open the developer console (Ctrl+Shift+I or Cmd+Option+I) 
- Look for [TaskMaster] debug messages
- Try the "Debug: Test Button Processing" command from the command palette
