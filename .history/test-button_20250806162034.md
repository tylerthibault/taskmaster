# TaskMaster Test File

This is a test file to verify that the TaskMaster plugin is working with both rendering methods.

## Inline Buttons (Original Method)

Here's a simple test button: {{multi-state-button:test-btn:todo}}

Another test button: {{multi-state-button:second-btn:in-progress}}

And a third one: {{multi-state-button:third-btn:done}}

## Code Block Buttons (New Method)

```taskmaster
button-id: codeblock-test-1
state: todo
group: default
description: This is a custom task button
```

```taskmaster
button-id: codeblock-test-2
state: in-progress
group: default
description: Click to cycle through states
```

```taskmaster
# This is a comment - you can add comments in code blocks
button-id: advanced-task
state: done
group: default
description: A more complex task with custom configuration
```

## Instructions

1. Load the TaskMaster plugin in Obsidian
2. Open this file in reading mode (Ctrl+E or Cmd+E)
3. You should see buttons instead of the syntax above
4. Click the buttons - they should cycle through states and show notices
5. Both inline `{{}}` and code block methods should work

## Code Block Advantages

- **Better Organization**: Easier to read and maintain
- **Descriptions**: Add hover tooltips  
- **Comments**: Add explanatory comments
- **Extensible**: Room for future features like assignments, time tracking, etc.
- **Context Detection**: Single command automatically chooses the right format

## Debug Information

- Make sure debug mode is enabled in TaskMaster settings
- Open the developer console (Ctrl+Shift+I or Cmd+Option+I) 
- Look for [TaskMaster] debug messages
- Try the "Debug: Test Button Processing" command from the command palette

If you see this working, both rendering methods are functional!
