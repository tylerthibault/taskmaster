# Lessons Learned - TaskMaster Development

This file tracks the solutions and approaches used to resolve issues during TaskMaster development, correlated with the TODO.md numbering system.

## 0. Core Setup & Infrastructure

### 0.1 Logging System Setup
**Problem**: Need comprehensive logging throughout the app for debugging purposes.

**Solution**: 
- Created a centralized `Logger` class in `src/utils/logger.ts`
- Logger respects the `debugMode` setting from plugin configuration
- Provides methods for `log()`, `warn()`, `error()`, and `debug()`
- Integrated logging into main plugin class and all major components
- All log messages are prefixed with `[TaskMaster]` for easy identification

**Key Learning**: Centralized logging with configurable debug mode allows for clean production builds while enabling detailed debugging when needed.

### 0.2 Dual Mode Rendering Setup
**Problem**: All elements need to render properly in both read and edit modes in Obsidian.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented `MultiStateButtonProcessor` with both code block and inline processing
- Used `registerMarkdownCodeBlockProcessor` for block-level buttons
- Used `registerMarkdownPostProcessor` for inline button syntax
- Created consistent button styling and behavior across both modes
- Buttons maintain state and functionality regardless of view mode

**Key Learning**: Obsidian requires separate processors for different markdown contexts, but shared logic can handle the common rendering and interaction patterns.

## 1. Core Features

### 1.1 Multi-State Task Toggles

#### 1.1.1 Custom Multi-State Toggle Implementation
**Problem**: Replace standard checkboxes with customizable multi-state toggles.

**Solution**: 
- Created button syntax: `{{multi-state-button:button_id:current_state}}`
- Implemented click-to-cycle behavior through all states in order
- Used CSS styling to match state colors defined in settings
- Buttons automatically update the source markdown when state changes

**Key Learning**: Custom syntax allows for flexible state management while maintaining markdown compatibility.

#### 1.1.2 Settings Infrastructure

##### 1.1.2.1 State Group Management
**Problem**: Need ability to create groups with different state orders.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented `TaskStateGroup` interface with configurable state arrays
- Created settings UI for adding/removing state groups
- Each group maintains its own progression order
- Default group ensures plugin works out-of-the-box

**Key Learning**: Flexible group structure allows different workflows while providing sensible defaults.

##### 1.1.2.2 Color Picker Integration
**Problem**: Need color picker for state customization with real-time application.

**Solution**: 
- Integrated Obsidian's built-in color picker component
- Colors apply immediately to all buttons with that state
- Used contrast calculation to ensure readable text on colored backgrounds
- Stored colors in hex format for consistency

**Key Learning**: Obsidian's native UI components provide consistent user experience and handle edge cases automatically.

#### 1.1.3 Inline State Cycling

##### 1.1.3.1 State Storage Format
**Problem**: Need reliable format for storing button state in markdown.

**Solution**: 
- Chose format: `{{multi-state-button:button_id:status}}`
- Button ID allows unique identification across the vault
- Current state enables persistence and restoration
- Syntax is readable and doesn't interfere with other markdown

**Key Learning**: Simple, structured syntax provides both human readability and reliable parsing.

##### 1.1.3.2 Proper Button Rendering
**Problem**: Multi-state buttons must render correctly in all contexts.

**Solution**: 
- Created dedicated `MultiStateButtonProcessor` class
- Implemented regex-based parsing for reliable button detection
- Used DOM manipulation for real-time state updates
- Ensured buttons inherit proper styling from theme

**Key Learning**: Robust parsing combined with proper DOM handling ensures consistent behavior across different markdown contexts.

##### 1.1.3.3 Table Compatibility
**Problem**: Buttons need to work inside and outside tables.

**Solution**: 
- Used inline span containers that work in table cells
- Implemented text node walking for finding buttons in complex DOM structures
- Button sizing adapts to container constraints
- Event handling works regardless of table context

**Key Learning**: Generic inline elements with proper event delegation provide maximum compatibility across markdown structures.

#### 1.1.4 Command Palette Integration
**Problem**: Need command palette entry for easy button creation.

**Solution**: 
- Registered "Create Multi-State Button" command
- Command inserts button syntax at cursor position
- Automatically generates unique button ID using timestamp
- Uses default state group for immediate functionality

**Key Learning**: Command palette integration significantly improves user experience by reducing the need to remember syntax.

## Development Setup & Infrastructure

### Plugin Architecture
**Problem**: Need maintainable, extensible plugin architecture.

**Solution**: 
- Separated concerns into logical modules (commands, processors, settings)
- Used TypeScript for type safety and better development experience
- Implemented proper plugin lifecycle management
- Created comprehensive settings system with persistent storage

**Key Learning**: Modular architecture with strong typing prevents many common plugin development issues and makes the codebase more maintainable.

### Build System
**Problem**: Need reliable build process for development and production.

**Solution**: 
- Used esbuild for fast compilation and bundling
- Implemented hot reload for development efficiency
- Created proper TypeScript configuration
- Set up version management system

**Key Learning**: Modern build tools significantly improve development velocity and help catch errors early in the development process.

## Next Steps

The foundation is now in place for implementing the remaining features in the TODO.md roadmap. The logging system will help debug future implementations, and the multi-state button system provides a solid base for building more complex task management features.
